My name is Om Joshi, and I am currently a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering and Plan II Honors student at The University of Texas at Austin.

- ðŸ”­ I just finished working on a [tournament tabulation and point tracking program](https://iqt.txfa.org) for Texas' state high school speech and debate organization 
- ðŸ¦¾ I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega
- ðŸŒ± As part of my recent foray into the Star Trek anthology, I started learning the Klingon language (via Duolingo)
- ðŸ“š The next step on my textbook self-study journey is to relearn all of physics with a more rigorous foundation -- currently, I am reading *An Introduction to Mechanics* by Kleppner and Kolenkow
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything `Python`-related!
