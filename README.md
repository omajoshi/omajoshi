### Hi there 👋

![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=omajoshi)

My name is Om Joshi, and I am currently a rising third-year Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Plan II Honors student at The University of Texas at Austin.

This summer, I am working at Intel in The Numerical Hardware Group, a new applied research consultancy within Intel's graphics group that works on challenging, interesting, and important problems in mathematical hardware design.

- 🔗 Here is my [website](https://omajoshi.com/) where I write about some of things I do
- 📝 I just rebooted my [blog](https://omajoshi.com/blog/) too, so let's see how long that lasts
- 🔭 Last year, I built a [tournament tabulation and point tracking program](https://iqt.txfa.org) for Texas' state high school 🏆 speech and debate organization
- 🦾 I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega
- 🌱 As part of my foray into the 🚀 Star Trek franchise, I started learning the ⚔ Klingon language (via Duolingo)
- 📚 The next step on my 📔 textbook self-study journey is to relearn all of physics with a more rigorous foundation. To that end, I am reading Weinberg's *Lectures on Quantum Mechanics* and Goodstein's *States of Matter*
- ⚓ I'm also currently reading *Six Frigates*, a book by Ian W. Toll on the early history of the US Navy and its titular first six warships
- 💬 Ask me about anything 🐍 `Python`-related!
