- 🔭 I just finished working on a [tournament tabulation and point tracking program](https://iqt.txfa.org) for Texas' state high school 🏆 speech and debate organization 
- 🦾 I am currently modeling and designing a physical Rubik's Cube scrambling and solving robot, using an Ender 3 3D printer, six stepper motors, some motor drivers, and an Arduino Mega
- 🌱 As part of my recent foray into the 🚀 Star Trek anthology, I started learning the ⚔ Klingon language (via Duolingo)
